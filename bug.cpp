std::vector<bool> is a specialized container in C++ that uses a bit to represent each boolean value, offering memory efficiency. However, it introduces several quirks that can lead to unexpected behavior and subtle bugs.

1. Non-Standard Iterator:
   -  Iterators for `std::vector<bool>` are not standard random access iterators. They do not satisfy the requirements of the standard iterator tags, leading to incompatibility with algorithms expecting standard iterators.

2. Element Access:
   - Direct element access using `[]` might not return a reference, leading to unexpected results if you modify the element through this method. This is a crucial difference from other standard containers.

3. Memory Layout and Operations:
   - The memory layout is not guaranteed to be the same as other standard containers. It does not store booleans as individual bytes, but packs them more compactly, complicating operations and potentially affecting performance.

4. Compatibility Issues:
   - `std::vector<bool>` has unique behavior that can cause incompatibility with algorithms that assume standard container behavior. Using standard algorithms like `std::find`, `std::copy`, or `std::transform` without proper considerations might lead to wrong results.

5. Lack of Some Standard Functions:
   - It might lack some functions available for standard containers.

Example:
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>

int main() {
  std::vector<bool> vec(5);
  vec[0] = true;
  // The following might not work as expected
  std::vector<bool>::iterator it = std::find(vec.begin(), vec.end(), true);
  return 0;
}
```
